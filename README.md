# 🏛️ Kindred Archive | Sovereign Specimen Studio

Kindred Archive is an autonomous design unit and digital repository dedicated to the curation of high-fidelity archival specimens. This repository serves as the public-facing authority and documentation hub for our automated production and distribution workflows.

## 🛰️ System Architecture Overview

The Kindred Archive operates on a decoupled, industrial-grade engine (ECHELON-SINGULARITY v6.0) designed for zero-entropy visual production.

- **Control Plane:** Orchestrated via n8n for state-machine management and asynchronous API calls.
- **Compute Node:** High-performance image processing (300 DPI), AI-upscaling (Real-ESRGAN), and PDF generation.
- **Storage Layer:** Immutable asset persistence via Cloudflare R2 (The Permanent Vault).
- **Distribution:** Seamless integration with Etsy (Storefront) and Pinterest (Visual Discovery).

## 🎨 Aesthetic Philosophy: Tectonic Stillness

Our work explores the intersection of brutalist meditation and mineral density. We produce "Archival Specimens"—visual anchors designed to provide sensory grounding in modern interior spaces. 

### Technical Standards:
- **Resolution:** All masters are rendered at a minimum of 300 DPI.
- **Provenance:** Every specimen carries a unique pixel-hash and dsl_fingerprint for traceability.
- **Materiality:** Focus on physical matter (Oxidized Copper, Carbonized Charcoal, Viscous Pigments).
